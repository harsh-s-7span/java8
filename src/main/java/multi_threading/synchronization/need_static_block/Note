-> Created two objects and try to book the seats.
-> I have used synchronised method.
-> There are two different objects, so it will produce inconsistent result.
-> Total seats are 10. But we are using two objects so each object contains 10 seats. (Total 20 seats)

=> Solutions

-> use keyword "static synchronise"
-> It will remove the concept of object level locking and apply the class level lock.
-> So, this code is now independent from the objects.
